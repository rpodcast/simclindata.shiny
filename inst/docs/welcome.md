# Sythetic COVID-19 Data Review Application

Welcome to the Sythetic COVID-19 Data Review Application. This application provides summary statistics, visualizations, and drill-down reporting based on simulated patient-level electronic health records (EHR). These records were generated using [Synthea](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/), an open-source patient population simulation tool. The simulation data utilized in this application accompanies the manuscript **[Synthea Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) model and synthetic data set](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666521220300077?via%3Dihub#bib14)**.
